# Ebirder Web Application

This project was built using React, Mongodb, Express.js, and Node.js

## Project Description

The project presents a companion application for birders and community scientists.

The web application is effectively an interactive map dashboard that details the userâ€™s sightings, notable recent sightings nearby, and common as well as rare species sightings in a given locale.

Our application allows a user to register/log in, record bird sightings on a map, view what other birds have been sighted in the area, and provides live data based on the map of what bird species are the most common and rarest in a given location. Furthermore, the application allows the user to search for bird sighting information in other areas using latitude and longitude query parameters.

To create an account, please use the sign up feature via the registration link in the application navbar. Then log in to access the full application.

To add a sighting, click on the map, fill out the new sighting form popup, and then submit. To edit or delete a sighting, click on a sighting on the form, and the click on either the edit or delete button.
